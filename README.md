## Abstract
Over the course of 5 days, I created a niche react app intended for the competitive Overwatch community. This app analyzes a player's account and gives the player a score based on their performance in the current ranked season. The app calculates their score based on their in game statistics, the higher the score calculated, the better the player (in theory). This app is meant entirely for fun and is meant to be used by players who would like to scout out a potential duo partner before commiting to queueing ranked with them.
